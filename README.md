[OpenDKP](https://www.opendkp.com) is an open source DKP system used across multiple games. This addon provides you the ability to keep track of your raid attendance in game and providing a helper utility to copy/paste those raid ticks into OpenDKP.

Given the limited capabilities with the WOW Addon system, our early MVP addon will allow you to simply keep track of attendance. Going forward, I'll be looking to add support for loot and other opportunities as I continue to learn LUA.

Huge thanks to the folks over at CEPEG/Alumian as I was able to leverage a lot of examples from their addon.
